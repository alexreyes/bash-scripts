# My bash scripts

Just some small scripts I've made to automate common repetitive terminal tasks. I think I'll start using this more because I need to backup my scripts between Mac <> Asahi Linux. 

## Git script: 

`gs [commit message]` 

is equivalent to `git add .` `git commit -m [commit message]` `git push` 

## Python new repo setup: 
`pySetup`

creates virtual env in current folder and activates it


## notes
I *just* started making bash scripts to automate common tasks and I gotta say... this is great!
